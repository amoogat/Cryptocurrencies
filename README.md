# Cryptocurrencies
After using Pandas to clean data on cryptocurrencies, I used sklearn to scale and cluster the data. Different sklearn algorithms were employed to determine correlations that tell a story about 4 different cryptocurrency patterns. An elbow curve was used to determine that 4 was a relevant number of clusters to start testing for, as can be seen in challenge.ipynb IN[13].
